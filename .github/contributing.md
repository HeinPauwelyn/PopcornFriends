## Is it a problem with the discription of a serie? 

Please **do not** tell us problems with the discription of a serie, season or episode. Because this comes from an external service named TVDB. They are responsible for wrong discriptions or missing series, seasons and episodes.

## Pull request?

Okey great, but it is to us to merge or close that request. If closed when they aren't bugs, we say "sorry, but it's not our primary features we will have". You will be notified with the exact reason why.

If you know there is a bug in the application or you've got a feature request, please made a new issue. Be clear and tell to us what's wrong in English or Dutch. We'll handle that issue if needed.

Please don't make a new issue or pull request if you need more information about the application! Only if you have a good reason like a bug report or feature request, you can contribute with us.

## Tips if you found a bug :bug:

Add **so many as you can** information in your discription like an error message and what you've done for got this bug.

## Is it a problem with the description of a serie? 

Please **do not** tell us problems with the description of a serie, season or episode. Because this comes from an external service named TVDB. They are responsible for wrong description or missing series, seasons and episodes.

## Pull request?

OK great, but it is to us to merge or close that request. If closed when they aren't bugs, we say "sorry, but it's not our primary features we will have". You will be notified with the exact reason why.
